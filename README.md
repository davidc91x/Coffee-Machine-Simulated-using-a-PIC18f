# Coffee-Machine-Simulated-using-a-PIC18f
During the project, the development will involve creating a welcome screen, controlling the coffee machine functions through input buttons, and implementing a state machine to manage the operation of the different elements. Additionally, the project will include reading sensors with the analog-to-digital converter, using the PWM module for temperature regulation with a fan, and integrating timers and other necessary peripherals for controlling the coffee machine. Finally, the project will require sending and receiving information via a serial line.
